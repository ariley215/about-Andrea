            <h3>Bio</h3>
            I'm Andrea, its nice to meet you. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm lucky enough to live three blocks from the beach, but I was born and raised in Philly with my younger sister, GO BIRDS! I have two cats, who will probably wander on screen at some point. They're names are Axl Rose and Sid Vicious.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            I graduated from boarding school in the Philly suburbs. After high school I tried undergrad and community college on and off for 8ish years before calling it quits before I wasted too much more money. Now I'm here, ready to learn some new skills.

            <h3>Jobs</h3>
            I started working in restaurants when I was 19. I've worked in a brewery, a country club, and countless others. I did a stint in retail at Nordstrom, that I loved, but life took me somewhere else. Before starting CodeFellows, I was working at an oceanfront restaurant.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            My goal is to move to Colorado in about four years. Hopefully by that time my sister and I will be able to start the process of getting our Italian citizenship. Eventually I want to buy property and move there. Hopefully with lots of adventures in between.
