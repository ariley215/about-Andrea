            <h3>My Bio</h3>
            I'm Andrea, its nice to meet you. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm lucky enough to live three blocks from the beach, but I was born and raised in Philly with my younger sister, GO BIRDS! I have two cats, who will probably wander on screen at some point. They're names are Axl Rose and Sid Vicious.

            My goal is to move to Colorado in about four years. Hopefully by that time my sister and I will be able to start the process of getting our Italian citizenship. Eventually I want to buy property and move there. Hopefully with lots of adventures in between.
